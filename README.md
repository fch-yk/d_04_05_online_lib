# Library

- The program parses [tululu.org](https://tululu.org/) library and creates its own offline website.
- You can also go to [an example of the website on GitHub Pages](https://yefimkorshever.github.io/d_04_05_site/).
- Furthermore, you can find the instruction how to get an offline example of the website [here](https://github.com/fch-yk/d_04_05_site).

## Prerequisites

Python 3.10 or higher required.

## Installing

- Download the project files.
- It is recommended to use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html?highlight=venv#module-venv) for project isolation.
- Set up packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running scripts
