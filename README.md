# Library

The program parses [tululu.org](https://tululu.org/) library and creates its own offline website.

## Prerequisites

Python 3.10 or higher required.

## Installing

- Download the project files.
- It is recommended to use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html?highlight=venv#module-venv) for project isolation.
- Set up packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running scripts

### Parsing

- Run:

```bash
python parse_tululu_category.py
```

- It's possible to input the start and end book ID.
For example, to download books with IDs from 21 to 23, run:

```bash
python parse_tululu_category.py --start_page 21 --end_page 24
```
